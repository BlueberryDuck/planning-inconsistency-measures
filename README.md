# Planning Inconsistency Measures

ASP/Python implementation of diagnostic measures for classical planning problems.

This implementation accompanies the Master's thesis _Inconsistency Measurement for Classical Planning Problems_ by Sebastian Bunge (FernUniversität in Hagen, 2026). Thesis sources: [BlueberryDuck/thesis-inconsistency-planning](https://github.com/BlueberryDuck/thesis-inconsistency-planning).

## Overview

Computes three measures that quantify goal conflicts in unsolvable planning problems:

| Measure | Name           | Description                                     |
| ------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| P1      | Unreachability | Goals that cannot be reached                    |
| P2      | Mutex          | Achievable goals that can never coexist         |
| P3      | Sequencing     | Goal pairs where achieving one blocks the other |

Each measure has `scope` (goals involved) and `struct` (conflict count) variants.

## Installation

```bash
# Docker (recommended)
docker compose build

# Or local install (requires plasp and clingo)
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
# Single ASP scenario
planning-measures compute tests/scenarios/p1_unreachability/locked_door.lp

# PDDL problem
planning-measures compute -d domain.pddl problem.pddl

# Custom horizon and timeout
planning-measures compute -d domain.pddl problem.pddl -H 30 -t 60

# Batch run (outputs CSV)
planning-measures batch benchmarks/diagnosis/ -o results/diagnosis.csv

# Help
planning-measures -h
planning-measures compute -h
```

With Docker: prefix commands with `./run.sh` (e.g., `./run.sh planning-measures compute ...`).

### Library API

```python
from planning_measures import compute_measures

# From PDDL files (uses plasp for translation)
profile, timing = compute_measures("problem.pddl", domain_path="domain.pddl", horizon=20)
print(profile)           # (1,3,0,0,0,0)
print(profile.category)  # "2a"
print(profile.summary()) # Detailed breakdown
print(timing.ground_s)   # Grounding time in seconds

# From pre-translated ASP file
profile, timing = compute_measures("problem.lp", horizon=20)

```

### Batch Benchmarking

Run measures on all problems in a benchmark directory:

```bash
# Via CLI
planning-measures batch benchmarks/diagnosis/ -o results/diagnosis.csv

# Via Python
python -c "
from planning_measures.batch import run_benchmark
run_benchmark('benchmarks/unsolve-ipc-2016/domains/FINAL/diagnosis', 'results/diagnosis.csv', timeout=120)
"
```

The runner auto-discovers domain/problem pairs using IPC naming conventions (`domain.pddl` + `prob*.pddl`, or numbered `dom01.pddl` + `prob01.pddl`). Output is a CSV with columns: `domain, problem, num_goals, num_props, num_operators, ur_scope, ur_struct, mx_scope, mx_struct, gs_scope, gs_struct, category, time_translate_s, time_ground_s, time_solve_s, time_extract_s, time_total_s, status`.

**Compatible IPC 2016 domains** (within 120s timeout): `diagnosis`, `pegsol-row5`, `bottleneck`, `cave-diving`, `document-transfer`, `chessboard-pebbling`. The `3unsat` domain from the Eriksson benchmarks is also compatible. Other domains timeout due to grounding complexity. See the thesis for details.

To run all compatible domains at once, use `skip_domains` to exclude known-incompatible ones:

```bash
python -c "
from planning_measures.batch import run_benchmark, KNOWN_INCOMPATIBLE
run_benchmark(
    'benchmarks/unsolve-ipc-2016/domains/FINAL',
    'results/ipc2016.csv',
    skip_domains=KNOWN_INCOMPATIBLE,
)
"
```

`KNOWN_INCOMPATIBLE` skips 9 domains that either fail with plasp (`:equality`) or timeout due to grounding complexity. Alternatively, pass `timeout=120` to `run_benchmark` to let them fail gracefully with `TIMEOUT` status in the CSV. Timeout is enforced by killing the child process with `SIGKILL`, which reliably terminates Clingo even during grounding.

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Architecture

Two independent layers:

- **Library** (`planning_measures/`): importable Python package with `compute_measures()`. Uses Python `logging` (no output unless caller configures a handler). Dependencies: clingo (Python), plasp (external).
- **CLI** (`planning_measures/cli.py`): `planning-measures` console script, installed via `pyproject.toml` entry point. Not imported by library or tests.

The PDDL pipeline:

1. **Preprocessing**: strips action costs from PDDL (irrelevant to inconsistency measures)
2. **plasp**: translates PDDL to lifted ASP representation
3. **Bridge encoding**: maps plasp vocabulary to internal predicates
4. **Brave reasoning**: Clingo explores state traces with `--enum-mode=brave`, computing the union of atoms across all answer sets
5. **Measure extraction**: Python computes P1 from set difference on `true_reachable`, P2/P3 from witness absence

Each phase is individually timed (`TimingProfile`), with grounding and solving measured separately to identify bottlenecks. Timeouts are handled at the CLI/batch level (not the library API) using subprocess-based process killing.

## Test Scenarios

Twelve hand-crafted ASP scenarios cover P1 (unreachability), P2 (mutex), P3 (sequencing), mixed conflicts, and edge cases. Each scenario has an expected `MeasureProfile` asserted by `tests/test_measures.py`.

Profile format: `(ur_scope, ur_struct, mx_scope, mx_struct, gs_scope, gs_struct)`. The profile also exposes problem size metadata (`num_goals`, `num_props`, `num_operators`).

See [tests/scenarios/README.md](tests/scenarios/README.md) for the full catalog, expected profiles, and the scenario file format.
