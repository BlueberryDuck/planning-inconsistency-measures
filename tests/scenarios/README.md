# Test Scenarios

Hand-crafted ASP scenarios for verifying the planning inconsistency measures (P1-P3).

## Profile Format

`(I^scope_UR, I^struct_UR, I^scope_MX, I^struct_MX, I^scope_GS, I^struct_GS)`

| Component   | Measure           | Meaning                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| I^scope_UR  | P1 Unreachability | Number of goals that are unreachable                    |
| I^struct_UR | P1 Unreachability | Number of propositions in unreachable dependency chains |
| I^scope_MX  | P2 Mutex          | Number of goals involved in mutex conflicts             |
| I^struct_MX | P2 Mutex          | Number of mutex pairs                                   |
| I^scope_GS  | P3 Sequencing     | Number of goals involved in sequencing conflicts        |
| I^struct_GS | P3 Sequencing     | Number of ordered pairs with sequencing conflicts       |

## Category Descriptions

### P1: Unreachability (`p1_unreachability/`)

Tests cases where goals cannot be reached from the initial state due to missing preconditions or impossible state transitions.

- **locked_door**: A goal requires a key that cannot be obtained
- **bank_vault**: Chain of dependencies where an early link is broken

### P2: Mutex (`p2_mutex/`)

Tests cases where goals are individually achievable but cannot coexist in any reachable state.

- **light_switch**: Two states (on/off) that are mutually exclusive
- **traffic_light**: Three-way mutual exclusion (red/yellow/green)

### P3: Mixed Conflicts (`mixed/`)

Tests cases with both mutex and sequencing conflicts, demonstrating that different conflict types can coexist.

- **trust_travel**: Achieving goal A makes goal B permanently unreachable
- **rival_alliances**: Multiple asymmetric sequencing dependencies

### Edge Cases (`edge_cases/`)

Tests boundary conditions and solvable instances to ensure no false positives.

- **coexisting_goals**: Multiple goals that can all be achieved together
- **single_goal**: Degenerate case with only one goal (no pairs to conflict)
- **empty_goals**: No goals defined (vacuously consistent)

## Running Tests

```bash
# From repository root - run all tests
./tests/run_all_tests.sh

# Run only ASP scenario tests
./tests/run_all_tests.sh measures
```

Expected output:

```
Testing p1_unreachability/locked_door... PASS (1,3,0,0,0,0)
Testing p1_unreachability/bank_vault... PASS (1,7,0,0,0,0)
...
Results: 9 passed, 0 failed
```

## Adding New Scenarios

1. **Create the scenario file** in the appropriate subdirectory:

   ```asp
   % tests/scenarios/p1_unreachability/my_scenario.lp

   % Initial state
   init(some_prop).

   % Goals
   goal(target_prop).

   % Operators
   operator(my_action).
   precond(my_action, some_prop).
   add(my_action, target_prop).
   ```

2. **Add expected profile** to `expected_profiles.txt`:

   ```
   p1_unreachability/my_scenario: (1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0)
   ```

3. **Run verification**:
   ```bash
   ./tests/verify_measures.sh
   ```

## Scenario File Format

Each `.lp` file defines a planning problem using these predicates:

| Predicate       | Description                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `init(P)`       | Proposition P is true in the initial state |
| `goal(P)`       | Proposition P is a goal                    |
| `operator(O)`   | O is an operator/action                    |
| `precond(O, P)` | Operator O requires proposition P          |
| `add(O, P)`     | Operator O makes proposition P true        |
| `delete(O, P)`  | Operator O makes proposition P false       |
